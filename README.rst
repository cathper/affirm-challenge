================

I simply just had fun with it while also playing with `docker`_ (which is
incredibly awesome).

The challenge
-------------

Take a look at the honeycomb (or hexagon grid) in my notes on page 1; okay, it's
hard to read. Find a `hexagon grid`_ and a hexagon in the centre, that one is 1.
Walk one down, that one is 2. Now, walk clockwise around 1 and name the hexagons
3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. Again, walk one down, that is 8. Again, walk clockwise etc.

Given two numerics, what is the distance between the two hexagons with those
numbers?

You should find the answer in constant time.
